I'm completely lost when it comes to Classes even though Michael has done the first part of the workshop. However, it doesn't mean that this is the end of the road for me. There are ways for me to figure this out if I look hard enough. In addition to the lessons, I want to see if I can study OOP (Object Oriented Programming) via the Eloquent Javascript book that we were suggested to read over the weekend.

Sorry to have let you down like this, but it seems I can't hack this one this time. I usually have a vague understanding of things that I am taught and I eventually get it, but this is a whole new enchilada that I need to delve deeper upon.

Hopefully this isn't a copy paste since...
1. I didn't want to leave you guys with nothing at all.
2. I wouldn't know how to do it another way.
3. I don't want to give in late work.
4. I was trying to follow along with what Michael was doing 

It's not like I was paying attention or anything, this is just a very foreign topic for me. Unless there is something that I'm missing, then by all means, remind me.
